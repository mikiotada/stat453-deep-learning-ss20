# Project Report Assessment


### Abstract: 15 pts

- Is enough information provided get a clear idea about the subject matter?
- Is the abstract conveying the findings?
- Are the main points of the report described succinctly?

### Introduction: 15 pts

- Does the introduction cover the required background information to understand the work?
- Is the introduction well organized: it starts out general and becomes more specific towards the end?
- Is there a motivation explaining why this project is relevant, important, and/or interesting?

### Related Work: 15 pts

- Is the similar and related work discussed adequately?
- Are references cited properly (here, but also throughout the whole paper)?
- Is the a discussion or paragraph on comparing this project with other people's work adequate?


### Proposed Method: 25 pts

- Are there any missing descriptions of symbols used in mathematical notations (if applicable)?
- Are the main algorithms described well enough so that they can be implemented by a knowledgeable reader?

### Experiments: 25 pts

- Is the experimental setup and methodology described well enough so that it can be repeated?
- If datasets are used, are they referenced appropriately?

### Results and Discussion: 30 pts

- Are the results described clearly?
- Is the data analyzed well, and are the results logical?
- Are the figures clear and have no missing labels?
- Do the figure captions have sufficient information to understand the figure?
- Is each figure referenced in the text?
- Is the discussion critical/honest, and are potential weaknesses/shortcomings are discussed as well? 

### Conclusions: 15 pts

- Do the authors describe whether the initial motivation/task was accomplished or not based on the results?
- Is it discussed adequately how the results relate to previous work?
- If applicable, are potential future directions given?

### Contributions: 10 pts

- Are all contributions listed clearly?
- Did each member contribute approximately equally to the project?

### Length, Formatting, and Citations:

- -25 pts if you submit the report in some arbitrary format and didn't use the report template.
- -10 pts for each page that goes over the 8-page limit (references are not counted; so you may have 8 pages of text + an infinite number of reference pages).
- -10 pts for each page below the 6-page minimum requirement (references are not counted; so you may have 6 pages of text + 1 to infinitely many reference pages).
- -10 pts for each missing image reference -- this means, if you are using an image that was not made by yourself and you don't cite the source, 10 pts will be deducted for each missing reference.
- -10 pts will be deducted where a sentence from a book or website is copied without citation. For example, consider the following sentence from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)

  - In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
  
If you use it in your text in the following way

> This section describes the machine learning methods used in this study. As a baseline model, the k-neared neighbors algorithm was used. In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. The distance metric ...

I will deduct 10 pts because you didn't indicate that you obtained the sentence from Wikipedia. However the following is ok:

a)

> This section describes the machine learning methods used in this study. As a baseline model, the k-neared neighbors algorithm was used. "In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression."\footcite{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm}} The distance metric ...

the following is also okay -- because you rewrote the sentence you don't need the quotation marks:

b) 

> This section describes the machine learning methods used in this study. As a baseline model, the k-neared neighbors algorithm was used. The k-nearest neigbhors algorithm is a so-called \texit{lazy} machine learning algorithm and non-parametric method that can be used for classification and regression.\footcite{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm}} The distance metric ...
